# Computational Topology

Projects based on  Herbert Edelsbrunner and J Harer's [Computational Topology : An Introduction](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/edelcomp.pdf)

The three main components of the code:

## Tringulation

## Simplicial Complex & Boundary Matrix

## Persistent Homology

These are some projects from a computational topology course that I took in Spring 2020.  Triangulation.py is a data structure to represent a triangulation.  PersistentHomology.py is an algorithm to compute the persistent homology of a manifold from its boundary matrix.
